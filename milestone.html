          <p>Milestone is my latest Career Foundry case study, it was done in a very short time, about a week to be exact.
            The result shows very well my overall improvement during the course.
            The guidelines in the brief were clear and straightforward, it was easy to stick to them without wasting any additional time. </p>
          <p>The research on competitor apps was crucial as well as the user testing done with low fidelity wireframes,
            I had the chance to test the user flow and correct some design mistakes.
            I really enjoyed the branding phase, it unleashed my creativity, starting from the logo I then built all aspects of the UI design,
            which I consider the best I've done so far in terms of quality. </p>
          <p>As it happened with other case studies I've done it would have been nice to develop more screens and do a bit more user testing,
            I realized that constant iteration is the path to follow if you want to develop a successful product. </p>
