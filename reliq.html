        <h1>Reliq</h1>
        <p>For this project, I decided to design an e-commerce app focused on vintage items and antique furniture and objects. Vintage items have become more and more popular since the last 20 years, a new type of collectors and vintage enthusiasts started to grow even in the younger generations, encouraged not only by the idea of obtaining collectibles but to reuse rather than buy brand new items, primarily to prevent damage to the environment by limiting the demand for new products and secondly for a matter of better quality in terms of materials and overall value. </p>
        <p>During this project I have been in charge of UX & UI design aspects, starting from the basic app concept to the development of high-fidelity prototypes for both iOS and Android platform. </p>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>After a quick search among the plethora of apps within the world of vintage e-commerce I noticed that most of them are based mainly on buying and selling clothes and accessories. This certainly makes them perform well among fashion enthusiasts but makes it weak towards all those users who, in addition to clothes, would like to furnish their homes with quality items that belong to the past, this is where "Reliq" comes into play. </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The app allows you to buy and sell vintage items of any value or type anywhere in the world. Through the app you can get in touch with your seller or buyer to request additional information about the product. The app's system will handle transactions in order to protect sellers or buyers from scams.
Reliq, since it requires the use of GPS is definitely better suited for a native mobile app instead of a responsive web app. Secondly, as a practical matter, using a mobile phone to take pictures of the items you want to sell is easier than using a desktop computer.
This app is designed for anyone interested in vintage items and collectors,
from clothes to antique furnitures, from age 18 to 70+.</p>

        <p>Milestone is my latest Career Foundry case study, it was done in a very short time, about a week to be exact.
          The result shows very well my overall improvement during the course.
          The guidelines in the brief were clear and straightforward, it was easy to stick to them without wasting any additional time. </p>
        <p>The research on competitor apps was crucial as well as the user testing done with low fidelity wireframes,
          I had the chance to test the user flow and correct some design mistakes.
          I really enjoyed the branding phase, it unleashed my creativity, starting from the logo I then built all aspects of the UI design,
          which I consider the best I've done so far in terms of quality. </p>
        <p>As it happened with other case studies I've done it would have been nice to develop more screens and do a bit more user testing,
          I realized that constant iteration is the path to follow if you want to develop a successful product. </p>
