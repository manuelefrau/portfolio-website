        <h1>Reliq</h1>
        <p>For this project, I decided to design an e-commerce app focused on vintage items and antique furniture and objects. Vintage items have become more and more popular since the last 20 years, a new type of collectors and vintage enthusiasts
          started to grow even in the younger generations, encouraged not only by the idea of obtaining collectibles but to reuse rather than buy brand new items, primarily to prevent damage to the environment by limiting the demand for new products
          and secondly for a matter of better quality in terms of materials and overall value. </p>
        <p>During this project I have been in charge of UX & UI design aspects, starting from the basic app concept to the development of high-fidelity prototypes for both iOS and Android platform. </p>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>After a quick search among the plethora of apps within the world of vintage e-commerce I noticed that most of them are based mainly on buying and selling clothes and accessories. This certainly makes them perform well among fashion
          enthusiasts but makes it weak towards all those users who, in addition to clothes, would like to furnish their homes with quality items that belong to the past, this is where "Reliq" comes into play. </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The app allows you to buy and sell vintage items of any value or type anywhere in the world. Through the app you can get in touch with your seller or buyer to request additional information about the product. The app's system will handle
          transactions in order to protect sellers or buyers from scams.
        <p>Reliq, since it requires the use of GPS, is definitely better suited for a native mobile app instead of a responsive web app. Secondly, as a practical matter, using a mobile phone to take pictures of the items you want to sell is easier
          than using a desktop computer.</p>
        <p>This app is designed for anyone interested in vintage items and collectors,
          from clothes to antique furnitures, from age 18 to 70+.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Following each platform's specific guidelines, iOS human interface guidelines and Material Design, I started to develop the prototypes on Sketch instead of using pen and paper.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Prototyping and Testing</h3>
        <p>After developing the high fidelity prototypes I created an interactive version of both the iOS and Android versions of the app using Sketch cloud.
          With the help of five different users I tested overall usability, user flow, and overall appearance.</p>
          <p>By analyzing the feedback I made the necessary changes based on user insights.  The final product can be tested by clicking the images below:</p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Considering the fact that I had very little time to develop this e-commerce app and that this achievement was mainly focused on the UI aspect I can still feel satisfied.
          I intentionally created a simple user flow to keep a basic approach focused on differentiating between the two different platforms, iOS and Android.</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed learning about the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design, it was very interesting and useful to better understand how I should move for future projects.</p>
        <p>If I were to implement this project I'd conduct a lot more user testing and focus on creating user personas that would meet the needs of a typical user interested in using an e-commerce app that specialized in vintage and antique items. </p>
