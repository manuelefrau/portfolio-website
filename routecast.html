        <h1>Routecast</h1>
        <p>The aim of the web app is to help the users to make the best decision while they travel.
          The users will be facilitated to plan a trip since the web app will give them specific weather data based on the
          route they choose. The web app will give the ability to save the route as favourites, this feature can help the
          kind of user who often travels the same route. The real-time weather feedback feature will help the overall
          accuracy of the web app. </p>

          <p>Getting good feedback from users is crucial. The interviews I conducted were necessary to understand which features
            potential app users consider useful and which ones are redundant. Based on the information I gathered I created user personas,
            thanks to them I didn't waste time developing useless features or thinking too much about embellishing the design.</p>

          <p>Based on the user flow diagram and with the help of the Crazy 8 technique I quickly drew the required paper prototypes
            refining more and more the basic structure of each screen.</p>

         <p>After correcting the issues detected during the usability tests I started to digitalize the
           paper prototypes turning them from low-fidelity into mid-fidelity prototypes.</p>

         <p>To make sure I was designing a good working responsive web app,
I used a mobile-first approach and then I determined the breakpoints
of each larger screen size. Here you see Planner's mockup screen displayed on an iPhone 11 Pro, an iPad Pro, and the MacBook Pro 16".</p>

        <div class="project">
          <p>So far the biggest project I have tackled, it took over a month to complete.
            The research was very thorough as I didn't know much about what is behind weather forecasting and location based
            applications in general. I am so proud of the result, I enjoyed every step of the process. </p>
          <p>The creation of user personas and interviews helped me a lot to focus on the users' needs,
            anyway I paid a lot of attention to the design details and data to recreate a prototype close to the real ones. </p>
          <p>I loved when I had to come up with the name of the app and consequently when I developed the logo.
            I realized then that responsive web apps are not that easy to develop but I took it as a challenge, I had fun even if
            I felt pressured. I'd like to keep working on it, iterating as much as possible, to get to see all the screens done. </p>
